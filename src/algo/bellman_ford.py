    Compute shortest paths and lengths in a weighted graph G

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source : node label
        Starting node for path

    target : node label, optional
        Ending node for path

    weight : string or function
        If this is a string, then edge weights will be accessed via the
        edge attribute with this key (that is, the weight of the edge
        joining `u` to `v` will be ``G.edges[u, v][weight]``). If no
        such edge attribute exists, the weight of the edge is assumed to
        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number.

    Returns
    -------
    distance, path, duration : pair of dictionaries, or numeric and list
        If target is None, returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
        The first dictionary stores distance from one of the source nodes.
        The second stores the path from one of the sources to that node.

        If target is not None, returns a tuple of (distance, path) where
        distance is the distance from source to target and path is a list
        representing the path from source to target.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

    source: list
        List of source nodes. The shortest path from any of the source

    weight : function
        The weight of an edge is the value returned by the function. The

        endpoints of an edge and the dictionary of edge attributes for
        that edge. The function must return a number.

    pred: dict of lists, optional (default=None)
        dict to store a list of predecessors keyed by that node
        If None, predecessors are not stored

    paths: dict, optional (default=None)
        dict to store the path list from source to each node, keyed by node

    target: node label, optional
        Ending node for path. Path lengths to other destinations may (and
        probably will) be incorrect.

    heuristic : bool
        Determines whether to use a heuristic to early detect negative
        cycles at a hopefully negligible cost.

    Returns
    -------
    dist : dict
        Returns a dict keyed by node to the distance from the source.
        Dicts for paths and pred are in the mutated input dicts by those names.
